Enhancements
A pause menu is accessible by pressing the escape button.
The pause menu allows you to adjust the Master volume, SoundFX, and Music levels for the game.
Background music has been added to enhance the gameplay experience.
There is a 10% chance of encountering a larger red ball instead of the standard one. The big red ball has greater mass and is more effective at breaking walls and slabs.
The game now features a start menu, a game-over menu, and an about menu for a polished user interface.
